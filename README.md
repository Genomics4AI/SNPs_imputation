Test the implementation of conditional GAN for tabular data and compare to other imputation methods.
This code is to impute missing information in your typical cohort data.
We want to impute missing snps data or other tabular data with ctgan a conditional generative adversiarial network for tabular data
We wan to compare this method to other imputation methods.
We still need to do try to implement more imputation method and examine/preprocess our excel file for NAN.
